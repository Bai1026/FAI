# Foundation of Aritificial Intelligence
- Homework and final project of Foundation of Artificial Intelligence, Spring 2024, National Taiwan University.

## HW1 and HW2 is from UC Berkeley Pacman Project
- [UC Berkeley AI material](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)
- about the **search** and **multi-agent search**

### HW1 - Search:
- Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

### HW2 - Multi-agent Search:
- Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

## HW3 and HW4 is for Machine Learning Part of the course
