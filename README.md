# Foundation of Aritificial Intelligence
- Homework and final project of Foundation of Artificial Intelligence, Spring 2024, National Taiwan University.

## HW1 and HW2 is from UC Berkeley Pacman Project
- [UC Berkeley AI material](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)
- about the **search** and **multi-agent search**

### HW1 - Search:
- Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

### HW2 - Multi-agent Search:
- Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

## HW3 and HW4 is for Machine Learning Part of the course
### HW3 - Linear Model, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- The goal of this programming part is to implement a supervised machine learning pipeline from scratch, which includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation of linear and nonlinear models on a given dataset.
- Apply this pipeline to a classification task and a regression task.
- Including preprocessing, models, training, and evaluation.
- Dataset: [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) for classification and [Boston Housing dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv) for regression.


### HW4 - Implement PCA, Autodecoder, DenosingAutoencoder
- With different observation of these 3 models
  - Reconstruct images.
  - Different Eigenvectors of PCA
  - Different Architecture of DenosingAutoencoder
  - Different Optimizers
  - Observation of loss history
